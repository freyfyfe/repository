It was a dark and stormy night ... and Captain Lytton stubbed his toe on 
the dresser.

"Fiddlesticks!" he cried, and rang for Jeeves, the butler.

Thunder rolled through the wide and empty rooms of the Manor, so much 
emptier after the Captain's dear Delilah had passed.

Delilah, if only you did not have such a terminal fascination with 
precipitous ledges at great heights sigh the captain. He was unaware 
that the butler was slowly transforming into an octocat.

Rain was driven through the gaps under the French windows as jeeves 
licked his fur fastidiously.
